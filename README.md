# Train-of-Hope-App
An easy-to-use scheduling App .

Volunteering App by Train of Hope

..* Purpose: help coordinating volunteers

..* Whatâ€™s the problem: Train of hope organization uses Doodle for organizing Volunteers,
and they have larger need for an easy-to-use scheduling app, which takes into consideration their special requirements.

## I implemented User stories:
As a volunteer: I want one simple User Interface screen where I can state my availability for an event,

As an organizer: I want to add multiple events to one page, and to show what competence we need.
